Requires
===================================

The minimum supported version of Python will be set to
``python_requires`` in ``setup``.  All supported minor versions of
Python will be in the test matrix and have binary artifacts built
for releases.

The code uses ``pandas`` for reading/writing excel or csv files. Numpy is used in some processing.
Regex allows to extract the number of atoms. Matplotlib is used for visualization.
